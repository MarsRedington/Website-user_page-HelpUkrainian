        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>
          Our project began with one person who could not sit still, watching
          Ukrainian newcomers struggle to adjust to living in Canada. In her
          aspiration to help these people build a new life in a new country, Ana
          Lokotkova gathered a team of like-minded volunteers who blended their
          shared passion, professional expertise and unique skills to scale our
          impact quickly.Â  Each of our volunteers is dedicated to empowering
          Ukrainian newcomers with top-quality support and resources. We believe
          that even the smallest things can make a big difference, and real
          change starts with every one of us.
