        <h2>Essential Job Searching Skills in Canada</h2>
        <h3>A series of practical workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Finding your dream job might be challenging, especially for a newcomer
          who knows very little about the specifics of the Canadian job market
          and hiring processes. You need professional guidance to assist you
          along the way, starting from your resume creation to job offer
          negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our volunteer team has designed a monthly series of four consecutive
          practical workshops, each four hours long, focused on essential skills
          needed across various stages of the job search process, including
          resume creation, interview preparation, and professional networking.
